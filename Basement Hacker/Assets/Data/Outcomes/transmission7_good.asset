  text: 'Unfoundland False Alarm Panic

    The world breathes a sigh of relief today as reports of an imminent cyber attack
    on Unfoundland was correctly identified as a false alarm. Government officials
    say this was the closest that King Harmon has came to declaring war on New Newland
    before an anonymous tip proved the erroneous data.'
